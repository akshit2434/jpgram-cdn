“ 💛 You matter more than you know, even on your hardest days. 💫”

On this World Suicide Prevention Day, let us break the silence and spread hope. There is always an availability of help for mental health issues. Reach out, talk, and listen to them without judgement. A conversation can save someone’s life. Hope is always within reach if you are struggling.

We can make a world where mental health is a priority. Remember that you are never truly alone, and be the light in someone’s life.
