‚≠ê Today marks the anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, on Gandhi Jayanti we remember a vision of hope and endurance.‚≠ê

On this day, every year, we celebrate the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi - an apostle of non-violenceüå∏. Today he stands as one of the stalwarts of modern-day India we look forward to.
