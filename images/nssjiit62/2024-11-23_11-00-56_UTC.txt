"Success doesnâ€™t happen overnightâ€”it takes vision, effort, and heart.
 
Rajat Sir's journey from NSS-JIIT to earning his place at "Ciena" is proof of that.
This achievement marks not just the start of a promising career but also a story of persistence and grit.
Congratulations, Rajat sir! Your NSS family stands behind you as you take this next step toward your dreams. ðŸŒ
