Did you know? 🌍 A single disposable pad takes 500-800 years to decompose! After an eye-opening session on menstrual hygiene, it's clear that switching to reusable products isn't just an option—it's a necessity. Reusable pads can last up to 5 years, reducing waste and cutting down on harmful plastic that pollutes our environment. Let’s lead the change toward sustainable periods. One small switch, a huge impact. ♻️🌱 #SustainablePeriods #EcoWarriors #SwitchToReusable #500YearsIsTooLong #MenstrualHealth #IITDelhi #GreenLiving
