We’ll guide you through the ins and outs of PyGame. By the end, you’ll have a game that’s not just playable but ready to showcase to friends (and foes). 

🗓️ Date: Tuesday, November 19, 2024
⏰ Time: 5pm onwards
📍 Venue: CL2 Lab

Bring your laptops (and your love for weirdly niche pixel-based games). Maybe unlock some IRL steam achievements in the process.
