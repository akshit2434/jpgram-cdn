Akshit is a final-year undergraduate with diverse yet deep interests in tech, science, data, the Cloud, and Infra. Heâ€™s constantly torn between these passions, and to fend off the frustration of picking just one, he tries to work at the intersections of these fields. He has an irrational and unparalleled love for all things Python.

Akshit often contributes to FOSS projects and volunteers in building FOSS communities. His passion for tech and community building drives him to make a meaningful impact in the world of FOSS.
