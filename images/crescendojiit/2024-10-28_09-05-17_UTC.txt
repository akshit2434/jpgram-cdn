"When genres collide, magic happens!"

Our college band, DEADW!NG, represented Crescendo with power and style at OASIS, BITS Pilani! 
In Tarang, they rocked the stage with two distinct songs: the intricate jazz-rock of Mr. Invisible by Thank You Scientist and the electrifying intensity of Shiva by Thaikkudam Bridge. Their standout performance secured them an incredible 
 ✨ 3rd position! ✨
