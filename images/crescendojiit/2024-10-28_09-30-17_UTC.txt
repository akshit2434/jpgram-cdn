Andholika – Western Solo Singing

"Love, loss, and everything in between."

Representing Crescendo at OASIS'24, BITS Pilani, Kishlay Gupta delivered a soulful rendition of All of Me by John Legend in the Andholika Western solo singing competition. 
With heartfelt emotion and smooth finesse, he captured the essence of the song’s timeless lyrics, resonating deeply with the crowd and earning a well-deserved ✨2nd place.✨ We’re incredibly proud of Kishlay for pouring his heart into this performance and showcasing Crescendo's talent with such passion (all while wearing shorts).
